Source code taken from other places. At the moment we have:

enet -- A cross-platform networking library for games, by Lee Salzman
(enet.bespin.org). Currently I am using enet 1.3.3, with custom
modifications to enet.h and protocol.c (to add an "averagePing" field
to ENetPeer).

guichan -- A GUI library by Olof Naess√©n and Per Larsson
(guichan.sourceforge.net).

Lua -- A scripting language (www.lua.org). I have included a subset of
the files from the Lua 5.1.4 release.

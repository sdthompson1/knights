//
// ActionData -- represents parameters passed to Lua in the "cxt"
// table.
//
// ACTOR is the creature who is performing the action. For most
// actions it is also the creature that the action is to be applied
// to. For example, A_PitKill kills the Actor (by making him fall down
// a pit), A_TeleportRandom teleports the Actor, etc. An exception is the
// melee actions, which are usually applied to the Victim instead (see
// below).
//
// VICTIM is only used with melee_action, and is set to the *target*
// creature. (Actor is set to the *attacking* creature for these
// actions.)
//
// ITEM or TILE will be set if the action came from a specific item or
// tile.
// 
// For ITEMs, a null dmap & mc for an item means "item not in map" ie
// someone is carrying it. A null mc but non-null dm means the item is
// going into the "displaced items" list. Null item itself means that
// no Item was given.
//
// For TILEs, null dm & mc means that no tile was given. Null Tile ptr
// means "no specific tile" (e.g. on_destroy when the destroyed tile has already
// been removed from the map).
//
// The GENERIC POS (lua cxt field "pos") will be equal to one of the item, 
// tile, actor or victim positions
// depending on what is most appropriate. For example, if the action being run
// is an "on_open_or_close" for a tile, then it will be the tile pos. If it is 
// "on_hit" for some item, it will be the item pos. Etc.
//
// ORIGINATOR is the player who set this action in motion. It's used
// for attributing kills (in certain actions). For example, if player
// 1 presses a switch which opens a pit beneath player 2, then
// A_PitKill is called with Actor set to player 2's knight and
// Originator set to player 1. The kill is then attributed to player
// 1.
//
// Also, when the item on_walk_over event is called, Originator is
// always set to the player who placed the item into the dungeon
// (rather than the player who, for example, teleported the knight
// onto the item). This is important for bear traps.

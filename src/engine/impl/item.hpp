/*
 * Items are things that can be picked up, eg crossbows, hammers,
 * potions, scrolls, traps, daggers, keys.
 *
 * Each item has an ItemType describing what sort of item it is, and a
 * number (some items can come in piles of more than one at a time, eg
 * daggers, crossbow bolts). Since items do not carry any state
 * information (eg. all hammers are identical) this is not a problem,
 * and it saves a bit of memory in some cases.

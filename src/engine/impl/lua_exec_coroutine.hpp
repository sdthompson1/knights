struct lua_State;

// Pops a cxt table, a function and n arguments from the stack, and 
// launches the function as a coroutine.

// If the function yields a number, then it will delay that many ms
// and re-execute after that time. (A Task is added to take care of
// this.) The yield will not return any values back to Lua.

// If the function returns, then the Task terminates.

// If the function yields anything else, or errors, then a message
// will be displayed to all players, and the task will be terminated.

// "cxt" will be saved and restored across yields.

// Return value: If the function returns first time (w/o yielding) 
// then we return the function's first result value, converted to
// bool. Otherwise, we return false.

/*
 * Resource streams. Like ifstream except we load from "resources"
 * rather than files. The idea is to abstract away details of where on
 * the filesystem the resources are actually located.
 *
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 * First, set the base directory by calling:
 * 
 * RStream::Initialize(base_path);
 *
 * Then, create one or more RStreams, passing a filename to the ctor,
 * e.g.:
 * 
 * RStream rs("somefile.txt");
 *
 * Note that resource paths are, by definition, binary strings of
 * bytes, with the following interpretation:
 *
 * A forward slash ('/') separates path components. A backslash ('\') is
 * also usable and treated the same as a forward slash.
 *
 * The colon (':') character is an error (to avoid any potential
 * clashes with Windows drive names).
 *
 * Any other character/byte is considered part of a path component.
 * Theoretically it would be possible to include non-ASCII characters
 * (e.g. UTF-8 encodings) but this is not recommended as only ASCII
 * has been tested.
 *
 * The path components have the following meanings:
 *
 * A path component of ".." means "go up to the parent directory".
 * Paths are normalized by removing redundant ".." components if
 * applicable; e.g. "dir1/../dir2/file" is considered equivalent to
 * "dir2/file". If a path tries to go "above the root", it is an
 * error; e.g. "../file" or "dir/../../file" would both be rejected.
 *
 * A path component of "." means "the current directory" and is
 * effectively ignored. E.g. "./file" is the same as "file". Also
 * (perhaps weirdly) "file/." is considered the same as "file".
 *
 * Empty path components are also ignored (in the same way as "."
 * components). E.g. "//file/" is the same as "file".
 *
 * Path components other than ".", ".." or "" are treated as directory
 * names (if not the right-most component) or a file name (otherwise).
 * The path is then mapped to a file on the local file system,
 * starting from the base path, in the obvious way.

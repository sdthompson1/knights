/*
 * Class representing the connection from a client to a Knights
 * server.
 *
 * Messages can be sent to the server by calling the methods of this
 * class. This will put data into the output buffer, this should then
 * be read with getOutputData() and sent to the server.
 *
 * When data is received from the server it should be processed by
 * calling processInputData(). This will convert any server commands
 * received into calls to the callback interfaces.

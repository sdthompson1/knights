// std::isspace has a bit of a gotcha because it takes an int rather
// than a char. Since char is signed, chars in the 128..255 range will
// convert to a NEGATIVE integer, but the behaviour of isspace is
// undefined for negative arguments.

// i.e.
// 
// char c;
// isspace(c);                 // WRONG -- undefined behaviour if c < 0.
// isspace((unsigned char)c);  // Correct.

// The same applies to other ctype functions - isdigit, toupper, etc.

// To avoid this whole issue I have created my own functions that take
// a char input and cast it to unsigned char. Problem solved!

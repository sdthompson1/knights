/*
 * Random number generator.
 *
 * getInt, getFloat return number in the range [a,b).
 *
 * Currently we use the Mersenne Twister RNG from Boost.
 *
 * The RNG is now setup to be thread specific. This is useful from a
 * debugging perspective because it means we can replay the exact
 * sequence of random numbers generated in a particular game, given
 * only the starting seed.
 *
 * There is still only one global access point to the RNG (g_rng); you
 * have to call initialize() once in each thread that wants random
 * numbers.

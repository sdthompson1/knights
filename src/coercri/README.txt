What's this?
------------

"Coercri" is a small library I have written to abstract out platform
dependent operations, such as graphics, sounds and network access. 

At the moment it is implemented on top of SDL and ENet.


Why not just use SDL directly?
------------------------------

I could have used SDL directly but I wanted the flexibility to use
other graphics libraries in the future, e.g. SFML, or calling DirectX
directly (on Windows). If I do decide to do that, I will only have to
add new backends to Coercri, rather than reprogramming large parts of
Knights.


Can I use this for my own projects?
-----------------------------------

Sure, although it is not documented and you may find bugs or things
that aren't implemented yet. If you have questions feel free to
contact me by email (address below).


What is the license?
--------------------

All files in the "coercri" directory are licensed under the Boost
Software License, version 1.0, reproduced below.

To clarify, it is only if the Coercri files are being used
independently (i.e. separately from Knights) that they would fall
under the Boost license. Knights itself is licensed under the GPL, and
therefore, if you want to use files from both Coercri and Knights,
your entire program would have to be licensed under the GPL.

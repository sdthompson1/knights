<h1>kts.Secure</h1>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>kts.Secure &ndash; "secure" a Home tile, preventing other knights from using it </p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p><code>success, reason = kts.Secure(wall_tile)</code> </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This function "secures" a home, making it unusable as an entry point by any knight, other than the knight who secured it. </p>
<p>If two different players (from different teams) secure the same home, then the home is removed, and turned into a copy of <code>wall_tile</code> (the parameter to this function), instead. The parameter must therefore be a valid <a href="Tile.html">Tile</a> object. </p>
<p>This function does not take any parameters indicating which knight is doing the securing or which home is being secured. Instead, the game looks at the <a href="cxt.html">cxt</a> table, and specifically the <code>actor</code> field, to determine which knight is acting, and then looks at the position one square "ahead" of that knight to look for a home to secure. This function is therefore best called from one of the item or tile callback functions, such as <code>melee_action</code> in <a href="ItemType.html">ItemType</a>, as the <code>cxt</code> table will already be correctly set up in such cases. </p>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>On success, there is exactly one return value which is <code>true</code>. </p>
<p>On failure, two values are returned. The first value is <code>false</code> and the second value is one of the following strings: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>"not_a_home"</code>: There is no home tile in front of the knight currently. </li>
<li><code>"already_secure"</code>: The home tile is already secured by this knight. </li>
<li><code>"special_exit"</code>: The home tile is a special exit point (e.g. an exit point associated with a "Guarded" exit). These homes cannot be secured, nor can they be used as normal entry points by knights. </li>
<li><code>"invalid"</code>: The call was invalid, e.g. the <code>cxt.actor</code> field was not set, or it was not pointing to a valid knight. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>If the input parameter is not a tile, then a Lua error is raised. </p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Historical note: Earlier versions of Knights would allow players to respawn at the "special_exit" point, if their previous entry point was secured, but this led to comical situations where a player would respawn at the Guarded Exit without having the key to get out &ndash; so therefore would be stuck there forever (or at least until another player came and "released" them). This was changed at some point to the current behaviour, where "special_exits" can neither be secured, nor used as spawn points by knights. </p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>This function is called from the <code>melee_action</code> of the Wand of Securing <a href="ItemType.html">ItemType</a>, in order to implement the special effect of that wand.

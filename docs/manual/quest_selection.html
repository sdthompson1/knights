<h2>3. Quest Selection</h2>
<!-- -*- mode: html; coding: utf-8; -*- -->

<p>Each game of Knights revolves around a quest &ndash; a set of
  objectives that players must accomplish in order to win. Before each
  game starts the players must decide which quest they wish to play.
  The game comes with a number of pre-defined quests to choose from,
  or you can design your own.</p>

<p>After joining a game the following screen will be displayed:</p>

<p><img src="images/quest_selection_1.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>(Note split screen and single player games use a cut-down version
  of this screen, without the chat area and player list.)</p>

<p>The main part of the screen, on the left, is taken up with the
 quest settings, which are explained below. The right-hand area is
 used for chat. At the bottom is a "Ready to Start" button; once all
 players click this, the game begins.</p>

<p>If you click "Observe" then you will "sit out" of the next game.
  You will be able to watch the game but not take part. To re-join the
  game again, click "Join Game" (note this can only be done from the
  quest selection screen, not during the game itself).</p>

<h3>Quest Settings</h3>

<p>To play one of the pre-defined quests, simply select it from the
  Quest drop-down. A brief description of the mission will appear in
  the small window at the bottom left.</p>

<p>To set up a custom quest, use the drop-down boxes to enter your
  desired mission objectives and other settings. (These are
  described in detail below.)</p>

<p>To allow the game to randomly choose a quest for you, click on
  "Random Quest". You can then either accept the quest as-is, make
  some tweaks of your own, or ask for another random quest.</p>


<h4>Quest Objectives</h4>

<p>The following options define what you have to do to win the
  quest.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Mission Type:</b> Can be set to:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Escape from the Dungeon:</b> Your knight must leave the
        dungeon via the exit point to win.</li>
      <li><b>Retrieve Book and Escape:</b> Your knight must retrieve
        the book and then escape via the exit point.</li>
      <li><b>Retrieve Wand and Escape:</b> Your knight must retrieve
        the wand and then escape via the exit point.</li>
      <li><b>Destroy Book with Wand:</b> Your knight must find the
        book, place it in the "special" pentagram and then destroy it
        by striking it with the wand. (The special pentagram will be
        surrounded by stairs or other decorations and is easily
        distinguishable from a normal pentagram. See
        also <a href="dungeon_features.html#pentagram">Pentagrams</a>.)</li>
      <li><b>Duel to the Death:</b> The last knight alive wins! In
        order to win this quest you will first need to "secure" all
        the entry points, so that your enemies cannot re-enter the
        dungeon when they die.
        See also <a href="items.html#wand_of_securing">Wand of
        Securing</a>.</li>
      <li><b>Deathmatch:</b> In this game you score one point for
        killing an enemy knight, and lose one point when you commit
        suicide. (Being killed by a monster is "neutral" and does not
        affect your score.) The winner is the player with the highest
        score when the time runs out. (If no time limit is set then
        the game will go on forever, or at least until the players get
        bored...)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Type of Book:</b> If the quest involves a book then you can
    choose from several types of book.
    See <a href="items.html#books">Books</a> for details.</li>
  <li><b>Type of Wand</b> and <b>Number of Wands:</b> The Dungeon may
    contain up to 8 wands. If there are multiple wands, they are
    always all of the same type.
    See <a href="items.html#wands">Wands</a> for details of each
    Wand's powers.</li>
  <li><b>Number of Gems</b> and <b>Gems Needed:</b> To make the
    quest more interesting you can require knights to find a certain
    number of gems before winning. Gems will be hidden randomly
    within the dungeon, usually inside chests or on tables. Gems
    have no powers or abilities, but if a knight is not carrying
    enough then he will be unable to win the quest.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dungeon Environment Settings</h4>

<p>The following settings affect the type of dungeon generated and the
  nature of the dungeon environment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Dungeon Type:</b> This affects the size and layout of the
    dungeon. Choose from Tiny, Small, Basic, Big, Huge, Snake, Long
    Snake or Ring.</li>
  <li><b>Premapped:</b> If set then knights will start with a complete
    map of the dungeon.</li>
  <li><b>Entry Point:</b> Controls where each knight enters the
    dungeon. Choose from Total Random, Close to Other (the knights
    start close together), Away from Other (the knights start far
    apart from each other), or Different every Time (a different
    random entry point is chosen every time you respawn).</li>
  <li><b>Exit Point:</b> This is the place where the knight has to go
    to escape from the dungeon. Choose from Same as Entry (leave via
    your own entry point), Other's Entry (leave via your opponent's
    entry point), Guarded (the exit point is behind locked doors and
    guarded by vampire bats), or Total Random (the exit point is at an
    unknown, random location). Note that Other's Entry is only
    available in two-player games.</li>
  <li><b>Starting Gear:</b> Knights may start the game with daggers,
    traps, both, or just their trusty sword.</li>
  <li><b>Number of Keys:</b> Controls the number of keys generated
    (between 1 and 3). If set to 1 then few doors will be locked; if
    set to 3 there will be more locked doors and all iron doors will
    be locked.</li>
  <li><b>Pretrapped Chests:</b> If this is enabled then some chests
    will be trapped at the start of the game.</li>
  <li><b>Amount of Stuff:</b> Controls the amount of equipment and
    items placed randomly into the dungeon at the start of the game.
    Can be between 1 and 5.</li>
  <li><b>Stuff Respawning:</b> This controls how quickly potions and
    scrolls respawn after use. Choose from Slow, Medium or Fast, or
    set to None to turn off respawning. Note that this only affects
    potions and scrolls; other items do not respawn.</li>
  <li><b>Zombie Activity:</b> If this is activated, then evil magic
    will cause the dead to start walking! Corpses will slowly decay
    and eventually rise up as zombies. The speed at which this happens
    can be set between 1 and 5, or it can be set to 0 to turn off
    zombie activity.</li>
  <li><b>Vampire Bats:</b> If this is activated then the dungeon
    will be filled with bloodthirsty vampire bats. Additional bats
    will also appear from pits. The number of bats can be set on a
    scale from 0 to 5.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Time Limit</h4>

<p>There is also an option to set a time limit. If the time limit runs
  out, then all players lose. (The exception is deathmatch games,
  where the player with the highest score will be declared the winner
  when time runs out.)</p>

<h4>House Colours and Team Games</h4>

<p>At the right-hand side of the screen, you can set your knight's
  House Colours. Knights of the same House are deemed to be allies;
  therefore, depending on the colours chosen, the game will either be
  "all against all" (if every knight has their own colour) or a "team"
  game (if some knights share the same colour).</p>

<p>In team games, there are some changes to the normal rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Friendly fire is disabled; your weapon blows will not harm other
  knights on your own team.</li>

  <li>Only one team member can complete the quest. For example, if the
  quest is to retrieve 3 gems and the book, then it is not allowed for
  one knight to take the gems, and another to take the book; there
  must be one knight who has both the gems and the book. However, as
  soon as one knight finishes the quest, all knights on that team will
  be declared "winners".</li>
</ul>

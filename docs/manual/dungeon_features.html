Dungeon Features</h2><p>Dungeons are generated randomly and can contain any of the following features. Some are helpful, and some are harmful.</p><p><img src="images/entry_point.png" alt="Entry Point"> <b>Entry Point:</b> This is where your knight enters the dungeon. If you are injured, returning to your entry point will heal you â€“ slowly. If you die, all items you were carrying will be dropped, and you will be returned to your entry point.</p><p><img src="images/entry_point.png" alt="Exit Point"> <b>Exit Point:</b> Most quests require you to escape from the dungeon via an exit point. Usually this will be the same as your entry point, but it could also be your enemy&#39;s, or some other, entry point. If you attempt to leave the dungeon without all necessary items, you will be informed of what you are missing.</p><p><img src="images/pit.png" alt="Pit"> <b>Pits:</b> There are Bottomless Pits. Do not enter.</p><p><img src="images/switch.png" alt="Switch"> <b>Switches:</b> Switches can have different effects. Some open doors or close pits. Some drop a portcullis behind you. Some trigger hidden crossbows inside skulls and walls.</p><p><img src="images/pentagram.png" alt="Pentagram"> <a id="Pentagram"></a> <b>Pentagrams:</b> Pentagrams contain powerful, if rather dangerous magic. They can grant invisibility or invulnerability, teleport you next to your opponent, or even turn you into a zombie. There are also some pentagrams which are merely painted onto the ground, and have no special powers.</p><p>In addition, in &quot;Destroy Book with Wand&quot; quests there will be one &quot;special&quot; pentagram. The special pentagram is always located at the top of several staircases and is easily distinguished from a normal pentagram. To win the quest, you must place the book onto the special pentagram and strike it with the wand to destroy it.</p><p><img src="images/crystal_ball.png" alt="Crystal Ball"> <b>Crystal balls:</b> By looking into a crystal ball (simply walk towards it) you will be able to see the location of enemy knight(s), as flashing dots on your map.</p><p><img src="images/wooden_door.png" alt="Door"> <b>Doors:</b> All doors begin the game closed. Some are also locked and will need a key, or lock picks, to open. Alternatively, you can just break them down with a suitable weapon!</p><p><img src="images/iron_door.png" alt="Iron Door"> <b>Iron Doors:</b> Unfortunately some doors are made of iron and cannot be knocked down. Most iron doors are locked and will require a key or lock picks to open. There are also some iron doors that can only be opened by pressing a switch elsewhere in the dungeon.</p><p><img src="images/portcullis.png" alt="Portcullis"> <b>Portcullises:</b> If closed, these will block your knight&#39;s path. They cannot be opened directly but they can sometimes be operated using switches or pressure pads.</p><p><img src="images/chest.png" alt="Chest"> <b>Treasure Chests:</b> These often contain useful items. They are sometimes locked, in which case they will require a key (or a well placed hammer blow) to open. If &quot;Pretrapped Chests&quot; is selected then they might also be trapped, so beware.</p><p><img src="images/chair.png" alt="Chair"> <b>Furniture:</b> There are various items of furniture, which don&#39;t do much, except maybe get in your way. The wooden barrels occasionally reveal hidden items when destroyed.</p><div class="footer2"><table><tr><td align="left"><a href="controls.html">Previous</a></td><td align="center"><a href="index.html">Contents</a></td><td align="right"><a href="items.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Controlling your Knight</td><td></td><td align="right">Items and Equipment</td></tr></table></div></body></html>

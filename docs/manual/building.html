      <h2>Appendix A: Building/Installing from Source</h2>

      <p>This Appendix gives information on how to build and
        install <i>Knights</i> from the source code.</p>

      <h3>Linux</h3>

      <p>For Linux a Makefile is provided. Most users should just be
        able to type <b>make</b> followed by <b>make install</b> to
        build and install respectively. After installing,
        type <b>knights</b> to run the game.</p>

      <p>Before compiling, make sure you have the necessary
        dependencies installed. The game requires Boost, SDL 2,
        libcurl, Lua, Freetype, Fontconfig and ENet. Also the
        pkg-config utility must be available (at build time). On
        Debian systems the following packages will satisfy the
        requirements:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>libboost-dev</li>
        <li>libboost-filesystem-dev</li>
        <li>libboost-system-dev</li>
        <li>libboost-thread-dev</li>
        <li>libsdl2-dev</li>
        <li>libcurl4-openssl-dev <i>or</i> libcurl4-gnutls-dev</li>
        <li>libfreetype6-dev</li>
        <li>libfontconfig-dev</li>
        <li>liblua5.4-dev</li>
        <li>libenet-dev</li>
        <li>pkg-config</li>
      </ul>

      <p>(If you only want to build the server, and not the game
        itself, then sdl2, freetype and fontconfig can be
        omitted.)</p>

      <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>On some Linux distributions you may get undefined
          references to &quot;clock_gettime@@GLIBC_2.2.5&quot; or
          similar. To fix this, append &quot;-lrt&quot; (without the
          quotes) to the BOOST_LIBS line in the Knights Makefile.</li>

        <li>If you get Boost related errors, check that you have at
          least version 1.48 of Boost, and that you have all the
          relevant Boost packages installed. Also, depending on your
          exact Linux distribution you might need to edit some of the
          Makefile options – see comments at the top of the Makefile for
          details.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>More Details</h4>

      <p>You can install only parts of the game by using the
        following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>make install_knights – install only the game (and its data
          files)</li>
        <li>make install_server – install only the server (and its
          data files)</li>
        <li>make install_docs – install only the documentation
          files.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>By default the game installs the &quot;knights&quot; and
        &quot;knights_server&quot; executables to /usr/local/bin/, data
        files to /usr/local/share/knights/, and documentation files to
        /usr/local/share/doc/knights/. The default install directory can
        be changed by setting the PREFIX variable, e.g. to install in
        your home directory use &quot;make PREFIX=$HOME&quot; and
        &quot;make install PREFIX=$HOME&quot;. (The PREFIX should agree
        between the make and make install commands, otherwise the game
        will not work!)</p>

      <p>For finer control of installation directories, use the
        following variables:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>BIN_DIR: location of the Knights binary (default:
          $(PREFIX)/bin)</li>
        <li>DATA_DIR: location of the Knights data files (default:
          $(PREFIX)/share/knights)</li>
        <li>DOC_DIR: location of the documentation files (default:
          $(PREFIX)/share/doc/knights)</li>
        <li>KNIGHTS_BINARY_NAME: name of the Knights executable
          (default: knights)</li>
        <li>SERVER_BINARY_NAME: name of the server executable
          (default: knights_server)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is possible to build a version without sound support by
        editing the Makefile and adding &quot;-DDISABLE_SOUND&quot; to
        the CPPFLAGS. This might be useful if sound doesn&#39;t work on
        your system for some reason.</p>

      <p>The Makefile also supports &quot;make uninstall&quot; (but
        make sure you pass the correct PREFIX or DIR variables, e.g.
        &quot;make uninstall PREFIX=$HOME&quot;, if you changed these
        from their default values).</p>

      <p>If you are developing, you may like to know that the Makefile
        is generated automatically from Visual Studio project files (see
        makemakefile.py in the python directory). The Makefile uses the
        &quot;Advanced Auto-Dependency Generation&quot; technique
        described
        here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080123214633/make.paulandlesley.org/autodep.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20080123214633/make.paulandlesley.org/autodep.html</a>.</p>

      <h3>Windows</h3>

      <p>Most Windows users will use the pre-packaged installer,
        however if you want to try building the game from source code,
        then read on.</p>

      <p>I will assume that you are building with Visual Studio. (You
        can get the Visual Studio Community Edition for free from
        Microsoft.)</p>

      <p>Before you start, note that Knights is currently
        using <a href="https://vcpkg.io/">vcpkg</a> for dependency
        management, so the first thing to do is install vcpkg on your
        local machine. Follow step 1 ("Set up vcpkg") from Microsoft's
        <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-msbuild?pivots=shell-cmd">Tutorial:
        Install and use packages with MSBuild in Visual
        Studio</a>.</p>

      <p>Next, obtain the Knights source code, either by downloading
        the latest source release from
        the <a href="https://www.knightsgame.org.uk/download">download
        page</a>, or by cloning
        the <a href="https://github.com/sdthompson1/knights">Git
          repository</a>.</p>

      <p>Then, navigate to the &quot;msvc&quot; folder within the
        Knights source code directory, and open Knights.sln. Then
        simply do &quot;Build Solution&quot; which will build the
        Knights game and server executables. (The first build might
        take a bit longer than usual, because vcpkg will automatically
        download and unpack all required dependencies, such as Boost,
        SDL2 and Libcurl.) Both Release and Debug builds are
        available.</p>

      <p>To run the game from within the IDE, you will need to do the
        following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Right-click on KnightsMain and choose &quot;Set as Startup
          Project&quot;.</li>
        <li>Right-click on KnightsMain, choose &quot;Properties&quot;,
          go to &quot;Configuration Properties → Debugging → Command
          Arguments&quot;, and enter &quot;-d
          $(ProjectDir)\..\..\knights_data&quot; (without the
          quotes).</li>
        <li>Now you can just press F5 to run the game.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You can run the command-line server by setting KnightsSvrMain
        as the startup project.</p>

      <p>If you want to build the installer you must
        install <a href="https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno
        Setup</a>. Then open a command prompt, cd to the Knights source
        directory and issue the following command:</p>

      <p><code>&quot;c:\program files (x86)\inno setup 6\iscc&quot;
          installer.iss</code></p>

      <p>This will make an &quot;Output&quot; directory and build the
        Knights installer there.</p>

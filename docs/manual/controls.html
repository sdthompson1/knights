<h2>5. Controlling your Knight</h2>
<!-- -*- mode: html; coding: utf-8; -*- -->

<p>Knights now has two different control systems: the "new" and "old"
  systems. The new system is the default, and if you haven't played
  Knights before, you may find this the easier of the two to use.</p>

<p>You can switch control systems from
  the <a href="options.html">Options</a> screen.</p>


<h3>New control system (the default)</h3>

<h4>Moving your knight</h4>

<p>To move, use the WASD keys. Your knight will carry on moving until
  he reaches the next dungeon square.</p>

<h4>Approaching</h4>

<p>Some dungeon squares (such as doors or chests) require you to
  "approach" them before you can interact with them. To approach a
  square, move your knight towards the square, and keep the movement
  key held down.</p>

<h4>The Action Bar</h4>

<p>Below the main dungeon view you will see an Action Bar. Clicking
  the icons here (with the left mouse button) will make your knight
  perform various actions, as follows:</p>

<p><img src="images/menu_fist.png" alt="Attack"> <b>Attack:</b> Attack
  with your current weapon. Keeping the mouse held down will attack
  repeatedly.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_open_close.png"
  alt="Open/Close"> <b>Open/close:</b> Open or close a door or
  chest in front of your knight.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_pickup.png" alt="Pick Up"> <b>Pick up:</b>
  Pick up an item. Items on the floor can be picked up directly, while
  items on tables or in chests require you to "approach" the table or
  chest (see above) before clicking this icon.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_axe.png" alt="Axe"> <b>Throw Axe:</b> Throw
  an axe that you are currently holding.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_crossbow.png" alt="Crossbow"> <b>Fire
    Crossbow:</b> Fire a crossbow. The crossbow must be loaded first
    (see <a href="items.html">Items</a>).</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_dagger.png" alt="Throw Dagger"> <b>Throw
    Dagger:</b> Throws a dagger in the direction you are facing. Note
    you will have to keep the mouse held down for a short time before
    the daggers start firing.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_drop.png" alt="Drop"> <b>Drop item in
    hand:</b> Drop currently held item onto the floor. You can also
    drop onto tables or into chests if you first "approach" them (see
    above).</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_drop_gem.png" alt="Drop Gem"> <b>Drop
  gem:</b> Drop a gem. This may be useful if you want to hide some of
  your gems in secret places, so that your opponent cannot get all of
  your gems simply by killing you.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_lockpicks.png" alt="Lock Picks"> <b>Lock
  Picks:</b> Attempt to open a locked door using the lock picks.
  You'll need to keep the mouse button held down while doing this.
  Picking locks takes some time, so be patient.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_beartrap.png" alt="Bear Trap"> <b>Bear
  Trap:</b> Sets a bear trap. The trap will be placed into the square
  in front of you.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_poison_trap.png" alt="Poison Needle
  Trap"> <b>Poison Needle Trap:</b> Sets a poison needle trap. This
  can only be used if you are approaching a closed door or treasure
  chest.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_blade_trap.png" alt="Spring Blade
  Trap"> <b>Spring Blade Trap:</b> Sets a spring blade trap. Again,
  this only works while you are approaching a door or chest.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_suicide.png" alt="Skull and
  Crossbones"> <b>Suicide:</b> Allows you to commit suicide. This can
  be useful if you get stuck somehow. To prevent accidental suicides,
  you need to hold down both mouse buttons to perform this action.</p>

<h4>Short Cuts</h4>

<p>The left and right mouse buttons can be used as shortcuts, as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking the <b>left mouse button</b> (while the mouse is outside
  the Action Bar area) allows you to pick up and drop objects, or open
  and close doors.</li>
<li>Holding the <b>right mouse button</b> makes your knight attack.
  This will either make a normal attack, throw an axe, or
  fire a crossbow, depending on the situation.</li>
</ul>

<p>These shortcuts allow you to perform most actions using only the
  WASD keys and the mouse buttons, with the Action Bar being used only
  rarely. Alternatively, you can ignore the shortcuts and do
  everything using the Action Bar, if you prefer.</p>

<h4>Parrying</h4>

<p>If you are carrying a sword, axe or staff then your knight will
  automatically try to parry any attacks coming from the front. There
  is no separate control for this, as parrying will happen
  automatically, assuming you are not pressing any keys or clicking
  any of the action icons.</p>

<p>The staff is the best parrying weapon, followed by the sword, and
  the axe is the worst. Hammers and crossbows are too clumsy, and
  wands too fragile, to be used for parrying.</p>

<h4>Other Controls</h4>

<p>Pressing ESCAPE in-game will bring up a display of the current
  quest. You can then press ESCAPE again to return to the game, or Q
  to quit.</p>


<h3>Old Control System</h3>

<p>The old control system is designed for players who are familiar
  with the original Amiga version of Knights.</p>

<p>The controls are based around four movement keys plus separate
  "action" and "suicide" keys. The default key assignments are as
  follows:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Player 1</th>
    <th>Player 2 / Network Games</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Up</th>
    <td>W</td>
    <td>UP ARROW</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Down</th>
    <td>S</td>
    <td>DOWN ARROW</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Left</th>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>LEFT ARROW</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Right</th>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>RIGHT ARROW</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Action</th>
    <td>Q</td>
    <td>RIGHT CTRL</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <th>Suicide</th>
    <td>F1</td>
    <td>F12</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These keys can be re-defined in
the <a href="options.html">Options</a> screen.</p>

<h4>Using the Action Key</h4>

<p>In this control system the Action Bar does not appear. Instead the
  Action key is used to perform all actions, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tapping the action key once will pick up an item on the ground, or
  drop your currently held item. (To pick up items from tables or
  chests, first approach the table/chest then tap the action key.)</li>
<li>Tapping the action key while you are approaching a door will open
  that door.</li>
<li>Tapping the action key while facing an open door closes that
  door.</li>
<li>Holding down the action key, then immediately pressing one of the
  direction keys, makes your knight attack. This will attack normally,
  throw an axe, or fire a crossbow, depending on the situation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Action Menu</h4>

<p>Holding down the action key for a longer period will open up the
  Action Menu. This is basically the replacement for the Action Bar in
  the old control system. The Action Menu looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="images/action_menu.png" alt="The Action Menu"> <br>

<p>Instead of clicking the icons, you select them by pushing one
  of the four direction keys (while still keeping the Action key held
  down). Otherwise the icons behave exactly as described above.</p>

<h4>Other Controls</h4>

<p>In the old control system, there is a separate key to commit
  suicide. This replaces the Suicide icon.</p>

<p>The ESCAPE key works the same as above (i.e. it brings up the
  quest menu and allows you to quit). In a split screen game, pressing
  ESCAPE will also pause the game.</p>

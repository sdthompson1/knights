<h2>2. Starting a Game</h2>
<!-- -*- mode: html; coding: utf-8; -*- -->

<p><img src="images/main_menu.png" alt="Main Menu"></p>

<p>When the game starts you are presented with the above menu
  screen.</p>

<p><b>Start Game</b> takes you to a sub-menu where you can start
  various types of games. See below for details.</p>

<p><b>Tutorial</b> lets you play through a short tutorial which will
  explain the basics of the game. Although the tutorial does not cover
  all aspects of the game, it should give you enough information to
  get started.</p>

<p><b>Options</b> allows you to adjust knight controls and graphics
  settings. See <a href="options.html">Game Options</a> for
  details.</p>

<p>Finally, <b>Credits</b> allows you to see who is responsible for
  this software, and <b>Quit</b> exits the game.</p>

<p>After selecting <b>Start Game</b> you will need to select one of
  the following options:</p>

<h3>Connect to Server</h3>

<p>This allows you to connect to a <i>Knights</i> server and play
online. You will be taken to the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="images/find_server_screen.png" alt="Connect to Server screen"></p>

<p>This lists all <i>Knights</i> servers currently active on the
  Internet and shows how many players are connected to each one. To
  connect, type the name you wish to be known by into the Player Name
  box, and then double click on one of the servers.</p>

<p>After connecting you will be taken to a lobby screen:</p>

<p><img src="images/lobby.png" alt="Lobby screen"></p>

<p>Here you can chat with other players or join a game
  of <i>Knights</i>. A server can be running more than one game at a
  time; the available games are listed at the top left. Double click
  on a game to join. Once a player joins a game, a new empty game will
  be automatically created.</p>

<p>Please note that all usage of a <i>Knights</i> server (including
  chat messages) may be recorded in the server logs. If you do not
  agree to this then please do not connect.</p>


<h4>Observing</h4>

<p>It is possible to observe a game, without actually joining in. To
  do this, first join the game as normal, then click the "Observe"
  button at the bottom right of
  the <a href="quest_selection.html">Quest Selection</a> screen.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you join a game that has already started, you
  will automatically join as an observer. (It is not currently
  possible to enter a game half-way through; you must wait until the
  next game starts if you wish to play).</p>


<h4>If nobody is online</h4>

<p>If nobody is online, you can minimize the <i>Knights</i> window
  (while on the main lobby screen &ndash; <b>not</b> the Quest
  Selection screen) and the window will automatically pop up again
  when someone connects. This allows you to do something else while
  waiting for someone to show up. (You can set <i>Knights</i> to run
  in windowed mode from the <a href="options.html">Options</a>
  screen.)</p>

<p>NOTE: Currently the auto pop-up only works on Windows. (I couldn't
  get it working in Linux; if anyone knows how to programatically pop
  up windows in Linux, please contact me! I tried XRaiseWindow but it
  didn't seem to work.)</p>


<h3>Host LAN Game / Join LAN Game</h3>

<p>These options allow you to play <i>Knights</i> over a LAN. The
  first player should select Host LAN Game, and the remaining players
  should select Join LAN Game. For the "joining" players, a list of
  all <i>Knights</i> games found on the local network will be
  displayed; double click on one to connect.</p>

<p>LAN games use UDP port numbers 16398 and 16399, so if you can't
  connect, check your firewall settings to make sure that nothing is
  blocking those ports.</p>

<p>If you join a LAN game half-way through, then you will become an
  observer. See "Observing" above.</p>

<p>Note that in the LAN mode, if the host player quits the game, then
  all other players will be automatically disconnected.</p>


<h3>Split Screen Mode</h3>

<p>This option allows two players to play the game using a single
  computer. One player takes the left half of the screen, and the
  other the right half. This works best if you use a piece of
  cardboard or other divider to make sure that players cannot see what
  is happening on the other player's screen. (This really does improve
  the game &ndash; it is no fun being invisible if your opponent can
  just look over at your screen to see what you are doing!)</p>

<p>The split screen mode is limited to two players only. To play with
  three or more players, you must set up a LAN or Internet game.</p>

<p>Also note that only the "old" control system can be used in split
  screen games. For more about control systems, see
  <a href="controls.html">Controls</a>.</p>

<h3>Single Player Mode</h3>

<p>This allows you to play a quest alone, with no opposition from
  other knights (although the vampire bats and zombies will still try
  to stop you). This is useful as a "practice mode" or for
  experimenting with various quests. Alternatively, you can set a
  time limit and try to complete quests against the clock.</p>


<h3>Playing online without using the official server</h3>

<p>If you want to play a game across the Internet, but don't want to
  use the official <i>Knights</i> server (for whatever reason), then
  you could try one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run your own server. See <a href="server.html">Running a
    Server</a> for details.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi2/">Hamachi</a>
  to set up a virtual LAN. I'm told this works well
  with <i>Knights</i>.</li>
<li>Use the LAN mode: it is in fact possible to play over the Internet
  using the LAN game mode &ndash; if you know the IP address of the
  host computer. The first player should select "Host LAN Game" in the
  usual way. The remaining players can then select "Join LAN Game",
  but instead of double clicking a game in the list, they should type
  the IP address of the host directly into the Address box. (The Port
  box can be left blank.) This will work even if the host machine is
  on the Internet rather than the LAN (as long as the relevant ports
  are not blocked).</li>
</ul>

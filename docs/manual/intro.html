<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<!-- -*- mode: html; coding: utf-8; -*- -->

<p><i>Knights</i> is a multiplayer game in which players must explore
  dungeons, fight vampire bats, zombies and each other, and try to
  complete a given quest. The first player to complete the quest is
  the winner.</p>

<p><i>Knights</i> is based on the Amiga game of the same name made in
  1994. Compared to the original, several new features have been
  added, including Internet and LAN game modes, support for more than
  two players, quest time limits, etc.</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>If you just want to get started quickly then I recommend playing
  through the Tutorial, which can be accessed from the main menu when
  the game starts up. This explains the controls and should give you
  enough info to start playing a few quests. For more details you can
  then refer back to the manual as needed.</p>

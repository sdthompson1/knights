<h2>7. Items and Equipment</h2>
<!-- -*- mode: html; coding: utf-8; -*- -->

<p>The dungeon is filled with useful items, treasures, and
  death-bringing instruments.</p>

<h3>Weapons</h3>

<p><b>Sword:</b> You will always have a sword. If you pick up
  something big, you will automatically put away your sword until you
  drop the new item. The sword is the best weapon for close combat,
  but cannot be thrown and is not much use for breaking things.</p>

<p><img src="images/axe.png" alt="Axe"> <b>Axe:</b> An average weapon.
  The axe does more damage than the sword, but is slightly slower. It
  can also be thrown, or used to smash wooden objects.</p>

<p><img src="images/hammer.png" alt="Hammer"> <b>Hammer:</b> The
  hammer does the greatest damage, but is rather slow and unwieldy for
  use in hand to hand combat. It is however the weapon of choice for
  smashing up furniture and other obstacles; it will destroy any
  wooden object in a single hit.</p>

<p><img src="images/staff.png" alt="Staff"> <b>Staff:</b> A staff
  cannot be used in combat, but is instead used for disarming traps.
  If you open a door or chest while holding a staff, then no trap will
  harm you.</p>

<p><img src="images/crossbow.png" alt="Crossbow"> <b>Crossbow:</b> A
  crossbow is a powerful weapon &ndash; if it is loaded. To load a
  crossbow you must hold both the crossbow and at least one bolt, and
  remain standing still. If loading is aborted (for example by moving)
  then you must start from the beginning again.</p>

<p><img src="images/bolts.png" alt="Bolts"> <b>Bolts:</b> Used as
  ammunition for the crossbow. Bolts are useless without a crossbow,
  and vice versa.</p>

<p><img src="images/daggers.png" alt="Daggers"> <b>Throwing
  Daggers:</b> These can be thrown from the Action Menu. They do
  little damage on their own, but can be deadly if used in large
  numbers. Note you will have to drop any weapon you are carrying
  (apart from the sword) before you can use throwing daggers.</p>


<h3>Magic Wands<a name="wands"></a></h3>

<p><img src="images/wand.png" alt="Wand"> The dungeon can contain up
  to eight wands (if there is more than one, they will all be of the
  same kind). Wands are used like weapons, and to release their power
  you need to physically hit your target. The types are:</p>

<p><b>Wand of Destruction:</b>
  Destroys any creature or wooden, breakable object.</p>

<p><b>Wand of Undeath:</b> Infused with black magic, this wand will
  destroy any zombie it strikes, and will also turn an enemy knight
  into one! Zombies are afraid of this wand and will retreat from any
  knight who carries it.</p>

<p><b>Wand of Open Ways:</b> Opens its target, be it a locked door or
  a creature :) </p>

<p><a name="wand_of_securing"><b>Wand of Securing:</b></a> Used to
  "secure" entry points so that other knights cannot use them. If an
  enemy knight secures your entry point, then you will be assigned a
  new entry point at random, which will be used for healing and
  re-entry from then on. If enemy knight(s) have secured <i>all</i>
  the entry points, and you die, then you will lose the game. Note
  that securing an entry point does not prevent you from using that
  entry point yourself, it only prevents your opponents from using it
  (unless <i>two</i> players have secured it, in which case it is
  effectively removed from the game). Finally, the Wand of Securing
  also does a small amount of damage in combat, so it can be used as a
  melee weapon.</p>

<h3>Books<a name="books"></a></h3>

<p><img src="images/book.png" alt="Book"> Some quests require you to
  retrieve a certain book from the dungeon. Some books also have
  magical properties. The following types exist:</p>

<p><b>Lost Book of Ashur:</b> A general book with no special
  properties. It will be hidden somewhere in the dungeon.</p>

<p><b>Necronomicon:</b> This Book of Dark Magic is always located in a
  necromancer's chamber behind locked iron doors. When taken for the
  first time, its powers are unleashed and any nearby corpses are
  raised as zombies. In addition, while this book is carried, zombie
  activity is automatically at its maximum.</p>

<p><b>Tome of Gnomes:</b> The mischievous Gnomes always hide their
  books behind devious traps and puzzles.</p>

<p><b>Ancient Book of Knowledge:</b> This book grants its holder a
  full map of the dungeon. Alas, your location will be visible to your
  opponent while you are carrying it.</p>


<h3>Traps</h3>

<p><img src="images/needle_trap.png" alt="Poison Needle
  Trap"> <b>Poison Needles:</b> These can be used to trap doors and
  chests. Any knight who sets off the trap will be killed, unless he
  is immune to poison, invulnerable, or carrying a staff.</p>

<p><img src="images/blade_trap.png" alt="Spring Blade Trap"> <b>Spring
  Blades:</b> These can also be used to trap doors and chests. A
  spring blade will fire (towards the direction from which the trap
  was originally placed) if someone opens or strikes the trapped
  object.</p>

<p><img src="images/bear_trap_closed.png" alt="Closed Bear Trap">
  <img src="images/bear_trap_open.png" alt="Open Bear Trap"> <b>Bear
  Traps:</b> Bear traps lying on the floor are either armed or
  unarmed. An unarmed bear trap <i>(left)</i> can be picked up or
  walked over without fear. Once picked up, you can then arm the trap
  and place it into an unoccupied square <i>(right)</i>. If a knight
  walks into an armed bear trap he will be injured and stuck for a
  while. Armed traps can be safely disarmed by striking them with a
  weapon.</p>

<p>As well as trying to trap your opponents, you can also use bear
  traps as alarms. The sound of a bear trap closing is loud enough to
  be heard from across the dungeon, so you can set the trap in a
  certain, strategic place, and you will then be alerted when somebody
  triggers the trap.</p>


<h3>Other Items</h3>

<p><img src="images/potion.png"
  alt="Potion"> <a name="potions"><b>Potions:</b></a> Magical potions
  can be drunk by picking them up. They have a variety of effects,
  mostly helpful but some harmful. Here is a list:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr><th>Name</th>           <th>Effect</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Healing</td>        <td>Heals your Knight</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Poison Immunity</td><td>Protects you from poison</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Poison</td>         <td>Kills you, unless you have poison immunity</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Paralyzation</td>   <td>Prevents you from moving for a while</td></tr>
  <tr><td>*Strength</td>      <td>Increases your strength</td></tr>
  <tr><td>*Quickness</td>     <td>Increases your speed</td></tr>
  <tr><td>*Regeneration</td>  <td>Makes you regenerate (auto-healing)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>*Invisibility</td>  <td>Makes you invisible</td></tr>
  <tr><td>*Super</td>         <td>Combination of strength, quickness and regeneration</td></tr>
</table>

<p>* Only one of these may be in effect at a time.<br>
  All effects (except healing) are temporary.</p>

<p><img src="images/scroll.png" alt="Scroll"> <b>Scrolls:</b> Scrolls
  are read by picking them up. Some may have effects similar to
  potions, but others can have additional effects, as follows:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr><th>Name</th>           <th>Effect</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Map</td>            <td>Reveals a complete map of the dungeon</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Teleport</td>       <td>Teleport you to a random other knight, or him to you</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Sensing</td>        <td>Shows you the location of all enemy knights</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Reveal Location</td> <td>Your location will appear on the map of all enemy knights!</td>
  <tr><td>Sense Treasure</td> <td>Shows the locations of any gems, wands and books in 
      rooms you have already mapped</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Invulnerability</td><td>Makes you invulnerable to all attacks (but you can still be killed
      by walking into a pit, or being turned into a zombie)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Amnesia</td>        <td>You lose your map of the dungeon</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Necromancy</td>     <td>You are turned into a zombie!</td></tr>
</table>

<p>After reading a scroll, its powers are consumed and it disappears.</p>

<p><img src="images/gem.png" alt="Gem"> <b>Gems:</b> Gems have no
  special effects or powers, but you may need to collect a certain
  number in order to complete your quest.</p>

<p><img src="images/key.png" alt="Key"> <b>Keys:</b> Used to open
  locked doors and chests. There are up to three keys in the dungeon
  &ndash; each door and chest will only be opened by one of the
  keys.</p>

<p><img src="images/key.png" alt="Lock Picks"> <b>Lock Picks:</b> An
  alternative way of opening doors and chests. Used via the Action
  Menu. The lock picks will open any lock, but take time to use.</p>


====== Original Knights Graphics, Sounds and Room Layouts ======

The original Amiga Knights was written by Kalle Marjola aka Reaper.
The sound effects were provided by Miku.

This version of Knights incorporates the graphics, sounds and room
layouts from the original Amiga game, which are available from the
following web site:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/marjola/games/design.shtml#knights

The Knights files have now been released under the GPL; see
amiga_knights/ks_disclaimer.txt for details.



====== Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) ======

This software includes a copy of the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
library. This is a cross-platform multimedia library, providing access
to graphics, sounds and so on. It is made available under the terms of
the zlib licence, the full text of which is included separately (see
third_party_licences/zlib.txt).

The latest version of SDL is always available from
http://www.libsdl.org/. 

(On the Windows version of Knights, you may upgrade to the latest
version of SDL by replacing the relevant DLLs in the Knights
directory.)

====== Other Software Used ======

Various other programs were used to create this version of Knights.
Here is a list:


* The GOLD Parsing System
  http://www.devincook.com/goldparser/

  A free parser generator. I used this to create a parser for the
  Knights configuration files (examples can be found in the
  knights_data folder).

  Please note that I only used the main GOLD parser generator tool. I
  did not use any of the 'engines' available from the GOLD site -- I
  found the C++ ones to be somewhat unreliable, so I wrote my own!

  [This is no longer used as I have now switched to Lua for
  configuration files.]


* Inno Setup
  http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

  This was used to create the Windows installer. (I find this a lot
  easier to use than NSIS, which is what I was originally using for
  installers.)


* ImageMagick
  http://www.imagemagick.org/

  The "convert" utility from this package was used for converting the
  graphics files from the original Amiga Knights.


* GIMP
  http://www.gimp.org/
 
  Image editing program.


* SOX
  http://sox.sourceforge.net/

  This was used to convert the original Amiga sound files to WAV
  format.


* SCons
  http://www.scons.org/

  A make replacement -- Describes itself as a "software construction
  tool".

  [No longer used as I now have a "makemakefile" script written in
  Python instead.]


* AMOS Professional 

  An Amiga programming language and development environment. This was
  used to develop the original Amiga Knights.


* Python 
  http://www.python.org/

  This was used for various purposes (e.g. to write scripts to convert
  the original Knights rooms data to a text file format).


* Emacs, for editing the source files


* GCC/G++, for compiling the code.


* SDL_TTF, a font rendering library, which was used in previous
  versions of Knights but has now been removed (in favour of just
  directly using FreeType).


Development was done both on Linux and on Windows (the latter using --
at various times -- Cygwin, Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition,
Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition, nuget, and vcpkg).

Knights Release 022
-------------------

KNIGHTS is a remake of a classic Amiga game for two players, in which
two brave Knights must journey deep into dangerous dungeons in order
to pursue their goals and to complete their assigned quests.

The original game was written by Kalle Marjola (a.k.a. "Reaper") and
all graphics, sound effects and room layouts are his work. You can
visit his website at http://iki.fi/marjola/.

This version has been programmed in C++ from scratch by Stephen
Thompson and has many improvements compared to the original, such as
support for multiple players (more than two) and network games.

For full instructions on how to play, please refer to the manual
(manual.html in this directory, or

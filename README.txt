Knights Release 028 -- Source Code
----------------------------------

This is the source code for KNIGHTS, a game of multi-player violent
dungeon bashing. (For more information about the game, please visit
https://www.knightsgame.org.uk/, or look in the docs/ directory.)

The game was originally written for the Amiga by Kalle Marjola; this
PC version is by Stephen Thompson. (See the amiga_knights directory
for more about the original Amiga version.)

This is the open source version of the game. A Steam version is also
available (or will be soon). The Steam version is based on the same
code, but includes additional features enabled by the Steam platform,
such as matchmaking and friends invites.


How to Build
------------

For Windows build instructions please read docs/building.html.

For Linux, a Makefile is provided. This should work "out of the box"
on Debian, but it might require some tweaks for other distributions;
please read the comments at the top of the Makefile for further
information.

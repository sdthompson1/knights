%cWelcome to Knights!

%lKnights is a multiplayer game involving several knights who must explore random dungeons and solve various quests.

If you haven't played before, you might like to start with the Tutorial, or play some singleplayer games for practice. However, remember that Knights is a lot more fun in multiplayer, so don't be afraid to jump in and join a few games online.

There is also a web-based system to help you find other players. Just go to "Server List" on the Knights website, and follow the instructions.

Have fun...

%cWelcome to Knights!

%lKnights is a multiplayer game involving several knights who must explore random dungeons and solve various quests.

%lIf you haven't played before, you might like to start with the Tutorial, which will explain the controls and the basics of the game to you.

After that, you can join a multiplayer game on the Knights server, or start up a LAN game. There is also a singleplayer mode, but this is mainly intended for practice -- this game is definitely more fun in multiplayer!

If you're looking for other players, check out the Knights game finder service -- go to the Knights web site and click Server List. You can use this to schedule a time to meet other Knights players online.

Have fun...

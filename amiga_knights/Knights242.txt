1. Overview
------------

 Knights is a two-player game of brave Knights who wander deep in the
 dangerous Dungeons pursuing their goal.

 The game requires two players and at least one joystick.

 Version 2.4 adds the following features:

    * A more efficient Dungeon generator, which creates almost unlimited
	number of different Dungeons
    * Bigger Dungeons
    * Dungeons containing more basic elements and rooms
    * Wands, Books, and a variety of starting gear
    * A selection of different Missions
    * Improved Knight control system
    * Clever monsters
    * New Potions and Scrolls
    * Information texts
    * Suicide possibility
    * Triggers and special traps
    * AA and NTSC support


 Version 2.42 got some minor improvements:

    * Shorter intro with no music
    * Mouse port disabling
    * A few new rooms
    * Information about missing files

 F2 disables mouse port		

 Game can be terminated with CTRL-C
 Switch between WB and game with LAMIGA+A

 Reposition screen CTRL+ARROWS
 During game, use ESC to return to game menu
 During game, use CAPS-LOCK to pause game


-------------
4. Game Menu
-------------

 Dungeon Environment Customization Menu:

 Use this menu to select aspects of the game
 Joystick UP/DOWN moves the selection box and RIGHT/LEFT changes values
 Press 'FIRE' to see additional information on selected item
 Press 'FIRE' while on [ continue... ] to begin game

 Here's an explanation of the menu items.

 Quests:

    There are several predetermined-determined Quests from which to select.
    Quest selection simply creates templates which may be customized
    with the options listed below them.


    Mission Specification. States the primary goal of the Quest.
    The options are:

    -Escape from the Dungeon-
     Find the required number of Gems (see below) and exit to win.

    -Duel to the Death-
     Win by securing all entry points with a special Wand of Securing
     (see below).

    -Retrieve Wand and Escape-
     Find the Wand in the Dungeon and escape with it. You may also
     need to retrieve some Gems (see below).

    -Retrieve Book and Escape-
     Find the Book in the Dungeon and escape with it. You may also
     be required to retrieve some Gems (see below).

    -Destroy Book with Wand-
     Find the Book, bring it to the special Pentagram at the top of
     the stairs (a very special place, easily distinguished from normal
     Pentagrams), find the Wand (and required number of Gems), and then
     hit the Book, lying in the Pentagram, with the Wand.

 Types of Books:

    If you have selected a mission with Book, one is hidden in the
    Dungeon. The Book is heavy and fighting while carrying the Book
    is impossible, so be careful while fighting and carrying it. The
    different kinds of books are:

    -Lost Book of Ashur-
     A general Book with no special place or special effects.

    -Necronomicon-
     This Book of Dark Magic is always in a conjurer's room behind
     locked Iron Doors. When taken, its powers are unleashed and any
     nearby corpses are raised as Zombies. Additionally, when this
     Book is carried, Zombie activity is automatically at its maximum...

    -Tome of Gnomes-
     This Book of Gnome Wisdom is always located behind clever traps
     or mechanical riddles.

    -Ancient Book of Knowledge-
     This Book automatically grants a map to its carrier. Alas, your
     enemy is always aware of your location if you carry it.

 Types of Wands:

    If there are any Wands in the Dungeon, they are all of the same
    kind. Wands are carried and used like any other (melee) weapons.
    When used, areas are filled with magical light. All targets must
    be physically hit with a Wand in order to work. The type are:

    -Wand of Destruction-
     Destroys any creature or wooden, breakable object.

    -Wand of UnDeath-
     A nasty Wand which destroys Zombies (and turns an enemy Knight
    into one)! No Zombie will attack the bearer of this Wand.

    -Wand of Open Ways-
     Opens its target, be it a locked Door or a creature (*grin*)

    -Wand of Securing-
     Used to 'secure' entry points so that your enemy cannot use them.
     After all entry points are secured, your enemy dies, having no
     way to enter the Dungeon and therefore loses the game. Securing a
     Door does not prevent Knight who secured the Door from entering
     that door (unless the other Knight has already secured that
     location...).

 Number of Wands:

    Some missions require that there is at least one Wand in the
    Dungeon.

 Number of Gems:

    Gems are almost always in Chests, but might be found on Tables
    as well.

 Gems Needed:

    The number of Gems a Knight must retrieve, in addition to any
    other mission requirements, before he can win.

 Dungeon Type:

    General layout of the Dungeon. If the selected type is too small
    for mission creation, it is automatically enlarged. Snake Dungeons
    are like very broad corridors.

 Premapped:

    Option to have the Dungeon automatically mapped (visible) when
    the game starts.

 Entry Point:

    Place where the Knights enter the Dungeon. Entry points remain
    the same during the game unless they are secured by your enemy
    with a Wand of Securing and the chosen method of entry is 'random'.

 Starting Gear:

    Knights may have additional equipment at the start of the game.
    The amount of extra equipment will decrease upon each death.

 Exit Point:

    The place where a Knight can exit the Dungeon. If a Knight
    arrives at this location before collecting all the required
    items, he will be told what he still needs.

 Number of Keys:

    Number of different Keys (and Locks). Additionally, there is
    always at least one Lock Pick which can be used to open any
    locked Door (if time is no problem...)

 Pretrapped Chests:

    Some Chests might be pretrapped with a Poison Needle or a
    Blade Spring if this option is selected.

 Amount of Stuff:

    The amount of various stuff (see below) lying on the floor
    and Tables.

 Zombie Activity:

    Determines how quickly dead bodies will transform into corpses,
    then raise to walk on Earth...

 Vampire Bats:

    Number of Killer Vampire Bats in the Dungeon.


-----------------
5. Screen layout
-----------------

 Your half of the game screen is divided into two parts. The upper part
 consists of a view of the room where your Knight is currently located.

 The lower part includes status information (from left to right):

    -Skulls-
     Tells you how many times you have died. Fortunately, lives are
     unlimited.

    -The Bottle-
     Tells you your life status, and if any special magical effect is
     currently affecting you. The meaning of the color of the Bottle
     contents is explained below in the equipment section. If the
     level of the liquid has lowered, find a healing potion or visit
     your entry point.

    -Equipment-
     Any small equipment stuffed into your pouches is shown here.

    -Map-
     A plan view of the Dungeon is drawn here. A Knight automatically
     maps any room he enters if there are no enemies to stop him.
     Additionally, you may find a Map Scroll, or the Dungeon might be
     premapped (if selected above). There is also a scroll named
     'Wipe Map'. No need to explain how nasty *it* is.

     YOU are shown as a blinking dot in your Map (if are able to map
     your current room). There are also Scrolls which tell you of your
     opponent's location. He is also shown as blinking dot on your Map.


--------------------------
6.Controlling your Knight
--------------------------

 A Knight is controlled by joystick (or the right-side player may be
 alternatively controlled with ARROW-KEYS and the RIGHT-SHIFT).

 AMIGA+ALT is used to commit suicide, if need be (never happened, but
 might be possible). Use this pair of keys on your side of the keyboard
 to commit suicide.


 Moving:

    Move your Knight in the desired direction by pushing the joystick
    to that direction.


 Fast item manipulating:

    Press 'FIRE' and push the joystick in the desired direction to use
    any of the following items currently in hand:

        Sword, Maul         to strike
        Axe                 to throw or to strike, depending on the
                            situation
        Wand                to zap
       *Crossbow            to fire (if loaded)
        Unloaded Crossbow,
        Staff or Book       to drop these

    * A Crossbow is automatically reloaded if you are not doing
      anything and if you have Quarrels with you.


 Parrying:

    Your Knight will automatically try to parry strikes coming from
    the front, if he has Sword, Axe or Staff in his hands, and the
    controller is not touched. Parrying with a Staff is easier than
    parrying with a Sword which is easier than parrying with an Axe.
    Mauls or Crossbows are too clumsy, and Wands too fragile, to be
    used as parrying weapons.


 Special Menus:

 The Action Menu: manipulation of items in the same square.

    By pressing 'FIRE' for a longer while, you are presented with the
    Action Menu, as long as you keep 'FIRE' pressed. By pushing the
    joystick to the appropriate direction the action (shown by icon)
    is performed. The Action Menu will remain on-screen as long as you
    keep the 'FIRE' button pressed. The Action Menu is used to pick up
    items, drop gems, and other special actions (eg., setting bear
    traps, picking locks).

    NOTE: You get the default action simply by pressing 'FIRE' for a
    very short period. The default action while standing in a square
    is picking up and dropping items. The Action Menu must be used to
    drop gems, throw daggers, or set bear traps.

 The Approaching Menu: manipulation of an item in the square in front.

    When approaching an adjacent square and pressing 'FIRE' (without
    releasing the direction) you are presented with Approaching Menu,
    which is used like the Action Menu, except the possible actions are
    different. In this menu, you can set Traps, pick Locks, put items
    in or on, or take items out of or from, Chests or Tables.

    NOTE 1: You may use a short click for the default action. The
    default action is opening, item taking, and closing. The special
    menus must be used when you want to pick locks or set traps.

    NOTE 2: Actions like opening and closing may be done in either
    special menu.

    NOTE 3: Menus are normally only used when setting Traps, picking
    Locks, or throwing Daggers, because a short click is easier and
    faster.


-----------------------
7. Dungeon Environment
-----------------------

 The Dungeon is a hostile environment with magical items and special
 places...

 7.1 Entry Point

    The place where your Knight enters game. If you are injured,
    visiting your entry point will heal you - slowly. If your enemy
    uses a Wand of Securing against your entry point, you will be
    given a new entry point, which is then used for healing and
    re-entry.

 7.2 Exit Point

    The place which you must find to win (excluding the -Duel to the
    Death- and -Book Destroying- scenarios). Normally, it is the same
    as your entry point, but may also be the same as your enemy's (or
    some other unknown's) entry point. If the mission is to escape the
    Dungeon with some number of specific items which you currently do
    not possess, you will be informed of what are you missing.

 7.3 Pits

    There are Bottomless Pits. Do not enter. 

 7.4 Switches

    Some switches open Doors or close Pits. Some drop a Portcullis
    behind you. Some trigger Crossbows inside Skulls and Walls.

 7.5 Pentagrams

    Some Pentagrams are harmless. Others are not, and include powerful
    conjurations which may transform you, render you invisible,
    invulnerable, or may even teleport you next to your enemy. Alas,
    sometimes it may even change you into a Zombie.

 7.6 Crystal Balls

    There are Crystal Balls in some Dungeons. Looking into one (approach
    it) will show you on your Map where your opponent is located.

 7.7 Doors and Chests

    All Doors and Chests are closed at the start of the game. Some may
    be locked, in which case, you must find a suitable Key or a Lock Pick.
    You may also simply try to break the Door down or smash the Chest.
    Unfortunately, there are also Iron Doors, which cannot be broken, but
    only opened with Keys or Lock Picks.


-----------------
8. Dungeon Items
-----------------

 The floor and Tables are filled with various items...

 8.1 Sword

    You will always have a Sword. If you pick up something big, your
    Sword is automatically placed into your Scabbard until you drop the
    new item. The Sword is the best weapon in a melee, but cannot be
    thrown (Why not?! Cries our Conan-clone) and is hopelessly bad for
    breaking things.

 8.2 Big items

    There are certain items that are so big that you can carry only one
    with you at a time. These are:

    -Axe-
     An Axe is an acceptable melee weapon, which can also be thrown. It
     is far better than a Sword when you need to destroy wooden objects.

    -Maul-
     A Maul is a mighty weapon - against inanimate objects. No wooden,
     breakable object can resist its force. In contrast, is it a very
     bad melee weapon.

    -Staff-
     A Staff cannot be used in melee in efficient way, because it is
     too lightweight to cause damage to armored Knights. Instead, it is
     used to disarm Traps. If your Knight opens a Door or Chest with a
     Staff in his hands, no Trap will strike him. (NOTE: Because a
     Staff is so bad as a melee weapon, it is automatically dropped
     if you press 'FIRE' with a direction (in the open). If you really
     want to strike something with it, you must use the Action Menu).

    -Crossbow-
     A Crossbow is a powerful weapon - if it is loaded. To load a
     Crossbow, you must have Quarrels and patience. A Knight will
     automatically load a Crossbow if he has Quarrels and stays in
     place. If loading is aborted (for example, by moving) you must
     start loading from the beginning again.

    -Bear Traps-
     Bear traps lying on the floor are either armed or unarmed. Unarmed
     are harmless and can be picked up or walked over without fear.
     Armed beartraps are open. If a Knight walks into one, he is injured
     and stuck for a while. After that, the Bear Trap is unarmed. Armed
     traps may be 'tripped' by striking them with some item. The item will
     not be harmed. Bear traps may be carried and dropped, or set in
     certain, strategic places. In addition to slowing down your enemy,
     they are quite useful as 'alarms' because the sound of one catching
     its victim will cause enough noise to alarm you.

    -Other-
     Book and Wands are big items too. Read about their special nature in
     section 4.

 8.3 Small items

    Certain items can be taken and carried by your Knight.

    -Gems-
     Some Dungeons include gems, which must be retrieved as part of the
     mission. Gems are carried like other small items, but can also be
     dropped. (Why drop gems? If you have many gems and your enemy kills
     you, he gets them all and may easily win. By hiding some of them,
     you know that he will not win by just killing you...).

    -Quarrels-
     Quarrels are needed with Crossbows. Either is useless without the
     other.

    -Daggers-
     Daggers can be thrown from the Action Menu. They are pretty harmless,
     but not completely useless, and might prove very dangerous when
     combined with magical quickness and large quantities.

    -Keys-
     Keys are needed to open locked Doors (well, at least Iron Doors).
     There are also Lock Picks, which can be used to open any Lock at
     any given time.

    -Poison Needles-
     Poison Needles are Traps that kill any Knight which tries to open
     an item trapped with them, unless he is currently immune to poison,
     invulnerable, or equipped with a Staff while opening the item.

    -Spring Blade-
     A set Spring Blade fires in the direction from which it was put
     into an object if someone opens or strikes the object. It is as
     dangerous as a Crossbow, and can only be disabled with a Staff
     (or by coming at the item from different direction).

 8.4 Potions

    There are magical Potions in the Dungeon, which can be drunk by
    picking them up. The effects from them are unpredictable, but
    mostly helpful. Here is a list of the different effects and their
    colors (shown in your life force Bottle):

    Name              Color           Effect
    ----------------- -----------     -----------------------------
    Healing           none            Heals your Knight
    Poison Immunity   flashing white  Gives immunity against poison
    Poison            dark green      Kills you!
    Paralyzation      green           Paralyzes you for a while
   *Strength          blue            Gives you superior strength
   *Quickness         violet          Gives you superior speed
   *Regeneration      orange          Regenerates you (auto-healing)
   *Invisibility      black           Makes you invisible
   *Super             multicolored    Makes you strong, fast and
                                      regenerated

    * Only one of these may be in effect at a time. All effects
    (except healing) are temporary.

 8.5 Scrolls

    In addition to Potions, there are Magical Scrolls, which are read
    by picking them up. Some may have effects similar to Potions, but
    there are also different effects, such as:

    Name              Effect
    ----------------- -------------------------------------------
    Map               Shows a map of the Dungeon
    Teleport          Teleports you near your enemy or him to you
    Sensing           Gives you and/or your enemy knowledge of
                      others' locations
    Sense Treasure    Shows you locations of any Gems, Wands or
                      Books in areas you've already mapped
    Invulnerability   Makes you invincible
    Map Wipe          You lose your map!
    Necromancy        You turn into a Zombie! (*UAAAAAA*)


------------
9. Critters
------------

 The Dungeons may include some nasty creatures...

 9.1 Vampire bats

    There are blood-sucking Vampire Bats with razor-sharp fangs which
    can even pierce plate armor. They are easily killed, but can just
    as easily kill a panicked Knight. Be warned, their sonar cannot be
    fooled by invisibility.

 9.2 Zombies

    Evil Magic will cause corpses to turn into Zombies. Zombies exist
    only to kill living Knights. They do not disrupt Bats. Zombies are
    tough and can break down Doors and Tables, so they can easily wander
    around the Dungeon...



---------------
10. Knights FAQ
---------------

 Here is some questions frequently asked (heh, at least one have done so)


 "Is there going to be modem version?"

   Apparently no. I have had not yet gotten enough inspiration to get back to 
   Amos long enough to make something so big, and I do not think I will ever 
   have :/


 "Control is a bit hard...I try to strike enemy approaching from north but my
  knight turns left"

   Using 'menu' to strike is not the way to go. Use button+direction shortcut,
   that's why it is there.


 "The game does not seem to work...screen goes black but then it returns to system"

   Apparently you have memory problems. Try to run it directly after booting without
   WB in background.


 "The game complains about missing fonts (running from HD)"

   Include knights-fonts in your fonts-folder in SYS:partition.


 "Could I get the source?"

   No. I have not yet made it publicily available. Maybe some other day.

11. Notes from Creator    
-----------------------

    I hope there is enough information in this document for you to
    completely master Knights. Creation of this game had been a nice
    way of spending my time during weekends and evenings, but 
    unfortunately I have had no time after release 2.4 (last spring)
    to improve it a much...so that's why this version 2.42 is almost
    identical to 2.4..despite the intro..

    
    I want to thank my friends for help;

        Miku for supplying those awful sound effects...
        Rami, Tommi, A.P. and my brother for playtesting and ideas...

    Thanks to James Keating for re-layoutting and enchanting this 
	document (those ugly parts are made by me _after_ his work )
 
    Thanks for all ideas and letters from all of you...so bad I had
	no inspiration enough to do them all :(



    And once again, I repeat:

        To fully enjoy this game, DIVIDE the screen with something.
        There's no fun in being invisible if your opponent can see
        you just by looking at your side of the screen!


    If you find any apparent bugs send me e-mail. If you like/dislike 
    this game, send me e-mail too. I like e-mail. Response 99.7 %

Amiga Knights Files
-------------------

This folder contains a few files from the original Amiga Knights
source code package -- mostly the graphics, but also the original game
manual (Knights242.txt) and the copyright notice (ks_disclaimer.txt).
There are also one or two scripts that I wrote to convert things into
more convenient formats.

KRD_NEW is an updated version of the KRD room data file. It contains a
few rooms, including a couple of gnome books, that seemed not to make
it into the original game. (If you've still got an Amiga then you could
try copying this file over the original KRD file in order to get a few
new rooms...)

Most of these files have been converted from their original
formats. If you want to see the files in their original Amiga form
then you can download the Ksource.lha file from Kalle Marjola's web
page at
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/marjola/games/design.shtml#knights

The Amiga game itself is also still available from Aminet:

See also ks_disclaimer.txt in this directory for the copyright
conditions for the original Knights files.
